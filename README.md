# I am MaxZboro (or WhiskeredSun)!
Amateur self-taught programmer. I code in Python since 2018 (I learned the core, now come the libs), and I am learning C++ for general development. Maybe, I'll switch to Rust.
Direction: no direction

### abandoned projects
 - Continuum: a 2D physics engine (you won't find 1.x.x, it's deprecated and GONE)
 - World's W-st Game Console: idk what this is (the second W can mean anything)
